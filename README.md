# Interview Task

**<--- Add here the description of the task to complete --->**

Spend no more than XXXXX time on this and using Create React App as a starting point is absolutely fine!

Add a README.md file with information about:

- How to run your code
- Technical decisions you made
- Shortcuts you made for time reasons
- Things you'd like to have done if you had more time

To submit the task to us:

1. Take a fork of this repo
2. Add a folder for the app with your solution
3. Make changes to your fork
4. Send us your work

Preferably send us the location of your forked version of the repo. If you want to keep your fork private please add access for @kudresov, @ChrisWestcottUK and @Krizzu

## Backend

The API is included in this repo and you can run it locally using Node v12 and yarn v1.

You can run in dev mode:

```sh
cd api
yarn
yarn start:dev

```

Or build the typescript project and run the built javascript:

```sh
cd api
yarn
yarn build
node . # or yarn start
```

This will start a webserver on port 4000:

- http://localhost:4000/graphql
- http://localhost:4000/doc
